1) If error proxy:
	1) git config --global --unset http.proxy
	2) proxy -p
	3) If their is an error to unset proxy then
		export -p
		unset HTTP_PROXY

2) To add files into repo using CLI:
	//git clone url
	git init
	git add filename or .
	git commit -m "comment"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/ShwetaRPawar/DEMO.git or url
	git push origin master
	
when we update the file after we push it into git then we do following
		git add .
		git status
		git commit -m "comment"
		git push origin master
	
3) List all information about username n all:
	1) git config --list

4) To add origin:
	git config add origin

5) To add new user to a perticular repository:
		git config user.name "name of user"

6) If we add user using global then this user display to all repository

7) Display current branch:
	git branch

8) To create new branch:
	git checkout -b newbranch
	git branch

9) Only to switch from 1 branch to other
	git checkout master or nameofbranch

10) Delete the branch:
		1) go to another branch then
			git branch -d nameofbranch

11) To push code in perticular branch:
	git push origin newbranch

---local stering remote

12) To remove all changes which we was do in file and disply original file without new i.e undo all changes
	git stash
13) For redo
	git stash pop

14) If some named file is on repo and suppose i m doing some changes in that file from remote and also from local .if i m pushing this file 	then it give m error so to avoid this 1st we have to pull all changes from remote and then merge all changes from remote as well as 
	local
	1) add something into file from local
	2) git add filename
	3) git status
	4) git commit -m "commit"
	5) git push origin bname
		it give an error
		
	6) git pull origin newbranch
	 follow steps from 2 to 5

15) To get difference bet 2 branch
	git diff bname1 banme2

16) Where we want to merge branch 1st we have to go to this branch eg
		git checkout master or bname
	after that merge the branch which want to merge
		git merge bname

17) Display all commit info:
	git log

18) Used to delete branch from repo:
	git push origin --delete newbranch

19) To download commits,files,and refs from remote repo into your local repo
	git fetch
	for eg i m creating new branch and in that add one file from remote repo. after that from CLI i m executing 
			git checkout branchname/fetch 	
	then it gives an error 'fetch' did not match any file(s) known to git. to avoid this execute
			git fetch
	it fetch all change do on remote repo to local and synchonize it after that execute
		git checkout bname/fetch

20) Suppose i m crating new file from remote repo then this file can fetch in local repo by
	git pull origin master
